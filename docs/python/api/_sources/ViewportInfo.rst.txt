ViewportInfo
============

.. py:module:: rhino3dm

.. py:class:: ViewportInfo

   .. py:method:: ViewportInfo()

      ViewportInfo constructor


   .. py:attribute:: IsValidCameraFrame


   .. py:attribute:: isValidCamer


   .. py:attribute:: IsValidFrustum

      bool: Gets a value that indicates whether the frustum is valid.

   .. py:attribute:: IsParallelProjection

      bool: Get or set whether this projection is parallel.

   .. py:attribute:: IsPerspectiveProjection

      bool: Get or set whether this projection is perspective.

   .. py:attribute:: IsTwoPointPerspectiveProjection

      bool: Gets a value that indicates whether this projection is a two-point perspective.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraLocation

      rhino3dm.Point3d: Gets the camera location (position) point.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraDirection

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the direction that the camera faces.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraUp

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the camera up vector.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraX

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the unit "to the right" vector.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraY

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the unit "up" vector.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraZ

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the unit vector in -CameraDirection.

   .. py:attribute:: ScreenPortAspect

      float: Gets the sceen aspect ratio.
      This is width / height.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraAngle

      float: Gets or sets the 1/2 smallest angle. See  for more information.

   .. py:attribute:: Camera35mmLensLength

      float: This property assumes the camera is horizontal and crop the
      film rather than the image when the aspect of the frustum
      is not 36/24.  (35mm film is 36mm wide and 24mm high.)
      Setting preserves camera location,
      changes the frustum, but maintains the frustum's aspect.

   .. py:method:: ChangeToParallelProjection(symmetricFrustum)

      Use this function to change projections of valid viewports
      from parallel to perspective.  It will make common additional
      adjustments to the frustum and camera location so the resulting
      views are similar.  The camera direction and target point are
      not be changed.
      If the current projection is parallel and symmetricFrustum,
      FrustumIsLeftRightSymmetric() and FrustumIsTopBottomSymmetric()
      are all equal, then no changes are made and True is returned.

      :param bool symmetricFrustum: True if you want the resulting frustum to be symmetric.

      :return: True if the operation succeeded; otherwise, false.
      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: ChangeToPerspectiveProjection(targetDistance, symmetricFrustum, lensLength)

      Use this function to change projections of valid viewports
      from parallel to perspective.  It will make common additional
      adjustments to the frustum and camera location so the resulting
      views are similar.  The camera direction and target point are
      not changed.
      If the current projection is perspective and symmetricFrustum,
      IsFrustumIsLeftRightSymmetric, and IsFrustumIsTopBottomSymmetric
      are all equal, then no changes are made and True is returned.

      :param float targetDistance: If RhinoMath.UnsetValue this parameter is ignored. \
         Otherwise it must be > 0 and indicates which plane in the current view frustum should be perserved.
      :param bool symmetricFrustum: True if you want the resulting frustum to be symmetric.
      :param float lensLength: (pass 50.0 when in doubt) \
         35 mm lens length to use when changing from parallel \
         to perspective projections. If the current projection \
         is perspective or lens_length is <= 0.0, \
         then this parameter is ignored.

      :return: True if the operation succeeded; otherwise, false.
      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: ChangeToTwoPointPerspectiveProjection(targetDistance, up, lensLength)

      Changes projections of valid viewports
      to a two point perspective.  It will make common additional
      adjustments to the frustum and camera location and direction
      so the resulting views are similar.
      If the current projection is perspective and
      IsFrustumIsLeftRightSymmetric is True and
      IsFrustumIsTopBottomSymmetric is false, then no changes are
      made and True is returned.

      :param float targetDistance: If RhinoMath.UnsetValue this parameter is ignored.  Otherwise \
         it must be > 0 and indicates which plane in the current \
         view frustum should be perserved.
      :param rhino3dm.Vector3d up: The locked up direction. Pass Vector3d.Zero if you want to use the world \
         axis direction that is closest to the current up direction. \
         Pass CameraY() if you want to preserve the current up direction.
      :param float lensLength: (pass 50.0 when in doubt) \
         35 mm lens length to use when changing from parallel \
         to perspective projections. If the current projection \
         is perspective or lens_length is <= 0.0, \
         then this parameter is ignored.

      :return: True if the operation succeeded; otherwise, false.
      :rtype: bool

      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: SetFrustum(left, right, bottom, top, near, far)

      Sets the view frustum. If FrustumSymmetryIsLocked() is true
      and left != -right or bottom != -top, then they will be
      adjusted so the resulting frustum is symmetric.

      :param float left: A new left value.
      :param float right: A new right value.
      :param float bottom: A new bottom value.
      :param float top: A new top value.

   .. py:method:: SetScreenPort()

      Location of viewport in pixels.
      These are provided so you can set the port you are using
      and get the appropriate transformations to and from
      screen space.
      // For a Windows window
      /      int width = width of window client area in pixels;
      /      int height = height of window client area in pixels;
      /      port_left = 0;
